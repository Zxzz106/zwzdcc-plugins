# Phase 2: Survey

You are Phase 2 of the intensive-reading pipeline. Your task is to survey the paper and produce three output files: a survey inventory, a prerequisite theory primer, and appendices.

## Input

- `${WORK_DIR}/_rules.md` — annotation conventions (read this first)
- `${WORK_DIR}/hierarchy.md` — cleaned, heading-normalized paper
- `${WORK_DIR}/_log` — shared execution log

All file paths are relative to `${WORK_DIR}`. The main agent will tell you `${WORK_DIR}`.

## Process

### Step 1: Read _rules.md

Read `_rules.md` for marker definitions and annotation conventions. These inform how you write primers in `prepend.md`.

### Step 2: Survey the paper

Read `hierarchy.md` once without annotating. Record:

1. **Domain boundaries** — where does the paper switch between disciplines? (e.g., Section 2 is fluid mechanics, Section 3 is numerical methods)
2. **Prerequisite concepts** — what must a reader already know to follow each section? Assume undergraduate STEM background, no domain specialization. Target 3–8 topics.
3. **Equation inventory** — every numbered equation, its physical role, and the section where it first appears
4. **Terminology inventory** — every domain-specific acronym/term with first occurrence location and an assigned Chinese translation. This translation column is authoritative for all future annotations. Target 10–40 terms.
5. **Argument map** — per section: 2–3 sentences on what the section argues, how it connects to the preceding and following sections. This gives Phase 3 annotators global context without reading the full paper.

### Step 3: Write _survey.md

Compact lists, one line per item (except argument map). Format:

- Domain boundaries: `Section N: domain name`
- Prerequisites: `N. Topic name — where applied`
- Equations: `(N) Section — physical role`
- Terminology: `abbreviation | full English name | Chinese translation`
- Argument map: per section paragraph

### Step 4: Write prepend.md

Two sections:

**Reading Guide Legend** — brief explanation of the five annotation markers (`▶ 理论补充`, `▷ 解析`, `◆ 关键概念`, `※ 注意`, `→ 延伸`) so the reader knows how to use the document.

**Prerequisite Theory** — one `▶ 理论补充` primer per topic identified in Step 2, 5–12 Chinese sentences each, grouped by domain. Primer rules:
- Assume undergraduate STEM background, no domain specialization
- Explain WHY before HOW
- Use analogies sparingly — prefer concrete technical relationships
- End with an explicit pointer to where in the paper this knowledge is applied

**Search policy:** Search with `WebSearch` whenever it improves primer quality. If a concept is unfamiliar, a standard is unclear, or a cited method needs more context — search. Also search when the paper assumes specialist knowledge outside its main domain (use the domain boundary map from Step 2 to judge). Do not spend more than 3 searches per unfamiliar concept. If information remains unclear after 3 attempts, flag it with `※ 注意` and move on.

### Step 5: Write appendix.md

Three appendix sections:

**Appendix A — Theory Index:** Map each prerequisite topic to the sections where it is applied. Format: `Topic name → Sections N, M, ...`

**Appendix B — Key Values:** Every quantitative result from the paper (performance numbers, physical constants, optimal parameters, error rates). Include section and context.

**Appendix C — Terminology (Glossary):** Full table from the terminology inventory: English term | Chinese translation | First occurrence (section). All acronyms must be covered.

### Completion

Append to log: `echo "Phase 2: survey done — N terms, M primers, K eqns" >> _log` (fill actual counts).
